# Test Metr


## Getting started

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```

### NPLC and voltage max input range can be set while the script is running

#### potentiometer_voltmeter.ino - sketch for arduino UNO using an active resistor for measuring voltage
#### voltage_divider_voltmeter.ino - sketch for arduino UNO using a voltage divider with two resistors for measuring. R1 = 10k ohm, R2 = 10k ohm
